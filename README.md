# Prosé

## What is Prosé?

Prose is a tool to help you organize your book club. Once you have created your book club members can find it and join. Once inside the club's profile, members are able to search for books and suggest them. Members can also vote for the books that other members have suggested. You can see the most popular books by checking out the "View Books" tab in the club's navbar. The book with the most votes will appear at the top.
